# Personality Evaluation
A hackathon project for Pennapps Fall 2014 that ended up being nothing. It was a test of whether we could discover the root of a person by reading through their personal messages. 

### Features
* Parsing through conversations and reading sentiment
* Track sentiment as the coversation continues

### A Note
The only reason I leave this project is because I refuse to delete my previous repos and it has some cool concepts attached with it that I could maybe revisit in the future.
